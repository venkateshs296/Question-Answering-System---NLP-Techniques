  "1": "Eton is one of ten English HMC schools, commonly referred to as \"public schools\", regulated by the Public Schools Act of 1868.",
  "2": "Following the public school tradition, Eton is a full boarding school, which means all pupils live at the school, and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys' public schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Harrow, Radley, and Winchester) to continue this practice.",
  "3": "Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England's statesmen.",
  "4": "Charging up to 11,478 per term (there are three terms per academic year) in 2014/15, Eton is the sixth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK.",
  "5": "Eton has a long list of distinguished former pupils.",
  "6": "David Cameron is the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and has recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.",
  "7": "Eton now co-sponsors a state sixth-form college in Newham, a deprived area of East London, called the London Academy of Excellence, opened in 2012, which is free of charge and aims to get all its students into higher education.",
  "8": "In September 2014, Eton opened, and became the sole educational sponsor for, a new purpose-built co-educational state boarding and day school for around 500 pupils, Holyport College, in Maidenhead in Berkshire, with construction costing around 15 million, in which a fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes, 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care, and a further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries.",
  "9": "About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships.",
  "10": "The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school.",
  "11": "In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.",
  "12": "Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase.",
  "13": "These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August).",
  "14": "Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling.",
  "15": "The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40-50 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level.",
  "16": "In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools.",
  "17": "The ISSP's aims are \"to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools\".",
  "18": "Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.",
  "19": "In the run-up to the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton's purpose-built Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park, officially known throughout the Games as Eton Dorney, provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event, attracting over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators.",
  "20": "Access to the 400-acre parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.",
  "21": "Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long, with eighteen - or possibly seventeen - bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed.",
  "22": "Only the Quire of the intended building was completed.",
  "23": "Eton's first Headmaster, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that finishes the Chapel today.",
  "24": "The important wall paintings in the Chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, had been built between 1441 and 1460.",
  "25": "As the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors.",
  "26": "Building resumed when Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517.",
  "27": "His name is borne by the big gate-house in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school.",
  "28": "This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.",
  "29": "The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that \"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton\".",
  "30": "Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there.",
  "31": "According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \"the manly character induced by games and sport\" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically.",
  "32": "In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's \"C'est ici qu'a t gagn la bataille de Waterloo\" (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.\")",
  "33": "As with other public schools, a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarize privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.",
  "34": "The project of establishing an 'Eton Mission' in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic.",
  "35": "However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected, many Etonians visited, and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys' Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.",
  "36": "The very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L K. Hall) were erected in 1906-8 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War.",
  "37": "Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the Great War.",
  "38": "A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in World War Two and blew out many windows in the Chapel.",
  "39": "The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone (194952) and by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens (1959 onwards).",
  "40": "In the past, people at Eton have occasionally been guilty of antisemitism.",
  "41": "For a time, new admissions were called 'Jews' by their fellow Collegers.",
  "42": "In 1945, the school introduced a nationality statute conditioning entry on the applicant's father being British by birth.",
  "43": "The statute was removed after the intervention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in the 1960s after it came to the attention of Oxford's Wykeham Professor of Logic, A. J. Ayer, himself Jewish and an Old Etonian, who \"suspected a whiff of anti-semitism\".",
  "44": "One boarding house, College, is reserved for seventy King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90% of full fees, depending on their means.",
  "45": "Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship.",
  "46": "The name \"King's Scholars\" is because the school was founded by King Henry VI in 1440.",
  "47": "The original School consisted of the seventy Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.",
  "48": "As the School grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in the town, outside the College's original buildings.",
  "49": "These students became known as Oppidans, from the Latin word oppidum, meaning town.",
  "50": "The Houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as \"dames\".",
  "51": "They typically contain about fifty boys.",
  "52": "Although classes are organised on a School basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House.",
  "53": "Each House has a formal name, mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community.",
  "54": "It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master, the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it.",
  "55": "Not all boys who pass the College election examination choose to become King's Scholars.",
  "56": "If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan Houses, they are known as Oppidan Scholars.",
  "57": "Oppidan scholarships may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in School and external examinations.",
  "58": "To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career.",
  "59": "Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the letters OS after his name.",
  "60": "The Oppidan Houses are named Godolphin House, Jourdelay's, (both built as such c. 1720), Hawtrey House, Durnford House, (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845, when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.",
  "61": "For much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys.",
  "62": "Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands.",
  "63": "A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\"",
  "64": "or \"Boy, Queue!",
  "65": "\", and all first-year boys had to come running.",
  "66": "The last boy to arrive was given the task.",
  "67": "These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s.",
  "68": "Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.",
  "69": "[citation needed] The long-standing claim that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of George III is unfounded.",
  "70": "\"Eton dress\" has undergone significant changes since its standardisation in the 19th century.",
  "71": "Originally (along with a top-hat and walking-cane), Etonian dress was reserved for formal occasions, but boys wear it today for classes, which are referred to as \"divisions\", or \"divs\".",
  "72": "As stated above, King's Scholars wear a black gown over the top of their tailcoats, and occasionally a surplice in Chapel.",
  "73": "Members of the teaching staff (known as Beaks) are required to wear a form of school dress when teaching.",
  "74": "Later the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek.",
  "75": "From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course.",
  "76": "In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings.",
  "77": "It used paper tape to store programs.",
  "78": "Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.",
  "79": "The primary responsibility for a boy's studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor.",
  "80": "Classes, colloquially known as \"divs\" (divisions), are organised on a School basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses.",
  "81": "New school buildings have appeared for teaching purposes every decade or so since New Schools, designed by Henry Woodyer and built 1861-3.",
  "82": "Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time.",
  "83": "Societies tend to come and go, of course, depending on the special enthusiasms of the masters and boys in the school at the time, but some have been in existence many years.",
  "84": "Those in existence at present include: Aeronautical, African, Alexander Cozens (Art), Amnesty, Archeological, Architectural, Astronomy, Banks (conservation), Caledonian, Cheese, Classical, Comedy, Cosmopolitan, Debating, Design, Entrepreneurship, Geographical, Henry Fielding, Hispanic, History, Keynes (economics), Law, Literary, Mathematical, Medical, Middle Eastern, Model United Nations, Modern Languages, Oriental, Orwell (left-wing), Simeon (Christian), Parry (music), Photographic, Political, Praed (poetry), Rock (music), Rous (equestrian), Salisbury (diplomatic), Savile (Rare Books and Manuscripts), Shelley, Scientific, Sports, Tech Club, Theatre, Wellington (military), Wine and Wottons (philosophy).",
  "85": "Prizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels.",
  "86": "In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts.",
  "87": "The most prestigious is the Newcastle Scholarship, awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics.",
  "88": "Also of note are the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C; and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject.",
  "89": "Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queens Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastles Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology.",

  "91": "Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad.",
  "92": "These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C.M.",
  "93": "Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, amongst others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.",
  "94": "If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\", storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity.",
  "95": "This award has been around since the 18th century.",
  "96": "As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys.",
  "97": "First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department.",
  "98": "Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.",
  "99": "The opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\".",
  "100": "This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature.",
  "101": "Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", which must be signed by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or writing lines.",
  "102": "In recent times,[when?]",
  "103": "a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.",
  "104": "A boy who is late for any division or other appointment may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7.35am and 7.45am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).",
  "105": "Tardy Book may also be issued for late work.",
  "106": "For more serious misdeeds, a boy is summoned from his lessons to the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.",
  "107": "This is known as the \"Bill\".",
  "108": "The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or rustication (suspension).",
  "109": "Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils might claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration.",
  "110": "John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor.",
  "111": "Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare posterior, which he administered privately in his office.",
  "112": "Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys.",
  "113": "Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers.",
  "114": "This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table.",
  "115": "Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke).",
  "116": "The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds.",
  "117": "This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.",
  "118": "The current \"Precentor\" (Head of Music) is Tim Johnson, and the School boasts eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include the School Hall, the Farrer Theatre and two halls dedicated to music, the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall).",
  "119": "Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo.",
  "120": "The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra, and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.",
  "121": "A former Precentor of the college, Ralph Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, which run at the School every summer.",
  "122": "Numerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively).",
  "123": "There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years.",
  "124": "The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.",
  "125": "Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.",
  "126": "In recent years, the School has put on a musical version of The Bacchae (October 2009) as well as productions of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (May 2010), The Cherry Orchard (February 2011), Joseph K (October 2011), Cyrano de Bergerac (May 2012), Macbeth (October 2012), London Assurance (May 2013) and Jerusalem (October 2013).",
  "127": "Upcoming in May 2014 was a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream .",
  "128": "Often girls from surrounding schools, such as St George's, Ascot, St Mary's School Ascot, Windsor Girls' School and Heathfield St Mary's School, are cast in female roles.",
  "129": "Boys from the School are also responsible for the lighting, sound and stage management of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.",
  "130": "Eton's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called \"Fourth of June\", a celebration of the birthday of King George III, Eton's greatest patron.",
  "131": "This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats.",
  "132": "Similar to the Queen's Official Birthday, the \"Fourth of June\" is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June.",
  "133": "Eton also observes St. Andrew's Day, on which the Eton wall game is played.",
  "134": "[citation needed] Until 18 December 2010, Eton College was an exempt charity under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2).",
  "135": "Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK.",
  "136": "As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks.",
  "137": "It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about 1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School.",
  "138": "This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \"assisted places\") to independent schools.",
  "139": "However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower.",
  "140": "Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.)",
  "141": "have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status.",
  "142": "The fee for the academic year 20102011 was 29,862 (approximately US$48,600 or 35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.",
  "143": "In 1995 the National Lottery granted money for a 4.6m sports complex, to add to Eton's existing facilities of two swimming pools, 30 cricket squares, 24 football, rugby and hockey pitches and a gym.",
  "144": "The College paid 200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only.",
  "145": "The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was \"deprived\" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with.",
  "146": "Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as \"staggering\" given the background of a substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country, a matter over which, however, neither the College nor the UK Sports Council, had any control.",
  "147": "The facility, which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre, opened in April 1999.",
  "148": "In October 2004, Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff.",
  "149": "She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art.",
  "150": "As evidence, Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department, Ian Burke.",
  "151": "An employment tribunal in July 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story.",
  "152": "It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.",
  "153": "It criticised Forsyth's decision to record a conversation with Harry as an abuse of teacherstudent confidentiality and said \"It is clear whichever version of the evidence is accepted that Mr Burke did ask the claimant to assist Prince Harry with text for his expressive art project ...",
  "154": "It is not part of this tribunal's function to determine whether or not it was legitimate.\"",
  "155": "In response to the tribunal's ruling concerning the allegations about Prince Harry, the School issued a statement, saying Forsyth's claims \"were dismissed for what they always have been - unfounded and irrelevant.\"",
  "156": "A spokesperson from Clarence House said, \"We are delighted that Harry has been totally cleared of cheating.\"",
  "157": "In 2005, the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools, including Eton, to have breached the Competition Act by \"regularly and systematically\" exchanging information about planned increases in school fees, which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School.",
  "158": "Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around 70,000, totalling around 3.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine.",
  "159": "In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another 3m to a new charitable educational fund.",
  "160": "The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked.",
  "161": "However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted).",
  "162": "She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.",
  "163": "They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\"",
  "164": "A Freedom of Information request in 2005 revealed that Eton had received 2,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.",
  "165": "Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies, Eton admitted that it was 'a bit of a mystery'.",
  "166": "The TaxPayers' Alliance also stated that Eton had received a total of 5,300 in CAP subsidies between 2002 and 2007.",
  "167": "Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having to do any farming at all'.",
  "168": "Figures obtained by The Daily Telegraph had revealed that, in 2010, 37 applicants from Eton were accepted by Oxford whilst state schools had difficulty obtaining entry even for pupils with the country's most impressive exam results.",
  "169": "According to The Economist, Oxford and Cambridge admit more Etonians each year than applicants from the whole country who qualify for free school meals.",
  "170": "In April 2011 the Labour MP David Lammy described as unfair and 'indefensible' the fact that Oxford University had organised nine 'outreach events' at Eton in 2010, although he admitted that it had, in fact, held fewer such events for Eton than for another independent school, Wellington College.",
  "171": "In July 2015, Eton accidentally sent emails to 400 prospective students, offering them conditional entrance to the school in September 2017.",
  "172": "The email was intended for nine students, but an IT glitch caused the email to be sent to 400 additional families, who didn't necessarily have a place.",
  "173": "In response, the school issued the following statement: \"This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise.",
  "174": "We take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation, overseen by the headmaster Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and ensure it cannot happen again.",
  "175": "Eton College offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families.",
  "176": "We deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused.\"",
  "177": "In January 2016, the Eton College beagling club was accused by the League Against Cruel Sports of undertaking an illegal hare hunt.",
  "178": "The allegations were accompanied by a video of the Eton Beagles chasing a hare, as 'the hunt staff urge the beagles on and make no efforts to call the dogs off.'",
  "179": "A spokesman representing Eton College released the following statement: \"Eton College takes its legal responsibilities extremely seriously and expects all school activities to comply with the law.",
  "180": "We are investigating this allegation as a matter of urgency and will be co-operating fully with the relevant authorities.\"",
