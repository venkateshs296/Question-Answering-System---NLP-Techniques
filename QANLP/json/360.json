  "1": "Richard Phillips Feynman (/fanmn/; May 11, 1918  February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model.",
  "2": "For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.",
  "3": "He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams.",
  "4": "During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.",
  "5": "In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.",
  "6": "Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics.",
  "7": "Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!",
  "8": "and What Do You Care What Other People Think?",
  "9": "and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust!",
  "10": "and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.",
  "11": "Richard Phillips Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City, the son of Lucille (ne Phillips), a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman, a sales manager.",
  "12": "His family originated from Russia and Poland; both of his parents were Ashkenazi Jews.",
  "13": "They were not religious, and by his youth Feynman described himself as an \"avowed atheist\".",
  "14": "He also stated \"To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory,\" and adding \"... at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'.\"",
  "15": "Later in his life, during a visit to the Jewish Theological Seminary, he encountered the Talmud for the first time, and remarked that he found it a \"wonderful book\" and \"valuable\".",
  "16": "The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new.",
  "17": "From his mother he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life.",
  "18": "As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios.",
  "19": "When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.",
  "20": "When Richard was five years old, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, but this brother died at four weeks of age.",
  "21": "Four years later, Richard gained a sister, Joan, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens.",
  "22": "Though separated by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world.",
  "23": "Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things.",
  "24": "Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe.",
  "25": "Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.",
  "26": "Feynman attended Far Rockaway High School, a school in Far Rockaway, Queens also attended by fellow Nobel laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg.",
  "27": "Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class.",
  "28": "An unspecified school-administered IQ test estimated his IQ at 123high, but \"merely respectable\" according to biographer James Gleick.",
  "29": "When he turned 15, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus.",
  "30": "In high school he was developing the mathematical intuition behind his Taylor series of mathematical operators.",
  "31": "Before entering college, he was experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as the half-derivative using his own notation.",
  "32": "He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to Princeton University in mathematics and physicsan unprecedented featbut did rather poorly on the history and English portions.",
  "33": "Attendees at Feynman's first seminar included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann.",
  "34": "He received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler.",
  "35": "Feynman's thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the WheelerFeynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laying the groundwork for the \"path integral\" approach and Feynman diagrams, and was titled \"The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics\".",
  "36": "At Princeton, the physicist Robert R. Wilson encouraged Feynman to participate in the Manhattan Projectthe wartime U.S. Army project at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb.",
  "37": "Feynman said he was persuaded to join this effort to build it before Nazi Germany developed their own bomb.",
  "38": "He was assigned to Hans Bethe's theoretical division and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader.",
  "39": "He and Bethe developed the BetheFeynman formula for calculating the yield of a fission bomb, which built upon previous work by Robert Serber.",
  "40": "He immersed himself in work on the project, and was present at the Trinity bomb test.",
  "41": "Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation.",
  "42": "On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary \"purple splotch\" afterimage of the event.",
  "43": "Feynman's other work at Los Alamos included calculating neutron equations for the Los Alamos \"Water Boiler\", a small nuclear reactor, to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality.",
  "44": "On completing this work he was transferred to the Oak Ridge facility, where he aided engineers in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents (for example, due to sub-critical amounts of fissile material inadvertently stored in proximity on opposite sides of a wall) could be avoided.",
  "45": "He also did theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which later proved not to be feasible.",
  "46": "Due to the top secret nature of the work, Los Alamos was isolated.",
  "47": "In Feynman's own words, \"There wasn't anything to do there.\"",
  "48": "Bored, he indulged his curiosity by learning to pick the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers.",
  "49": "Feynman played many jokes on colleagues.",
  "50": "In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 271828 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination.",
  "51": "He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.",
  "52": "On several occasions, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from Klaus Fuchs, who was later discovered to be a real spy for the Soviets, transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe.",
  "53": "Feynman alludes to his thoughts on the justification for getting involved in the Manhattan project in The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.",
  "54": "He felt the possibility of Nazi Germany developing the bomb before the Allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the U.S.",
  "55": "He goes on to say that it was an error on his part not to reconsider the situation once Germany was defeated.",
  "56": "In the same publication, Feynman also talks about his worries in the atomic bomb age, feeling for some considerable time that there was a high risk that the bomb would be used again soon, so that it was pointless to build for the future.",
  "57": "Later he describes this period as a \"depression\".",
  "58": "Following the completion of his PhD in 1942, Feynman held an appointment at the University of WisconsinMadison as an assistant professor of physics.",
  "59": "The appointment was spent on leave for his involvement in the Manhattan project.",
  "60": "In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to UW to teach in the coming academic year.",
  "61": "His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to return.",
  "62": "In a talk given several years later at UW, Feynman quipped, \"It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me.\"",
  "63": "After the war, Feynman declined an offer from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, despite the presence there of such distinguished faculty members as Albert Einstein, Kurt Gdel and John von Neumann.",
  "64": "Feynman followed Hans Bethe, instead, to Cornell University, where Feynman taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950.",
  "65": "During a temporary depression following the destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb produced by the Manhattan Project, he focused on complex physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction.",
  "66": "One of these was analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating dish as it is moving through the air.",
  "67": "His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, proved important to his Nobel Prizewinning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities.",
  "68": "Despite yet another offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, Feynman rejected the Institute on the grounds that there were no teaching duties: Feynman felt that students were a source of inspiration and teaching was a diversion during uncreative spells.",
  "69": "Because of this, the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University jointly offered him a package whereby he could teach at the university and also be at the institute.",
  "70": "[citation needed] Feynman instead accepted an offer from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)and as he says in his book Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!because a desire to live in a mild climate had firmly fixed itself in his mind while he was installing tire chains on his car in the middle of a snowstorm in Ithaca.",
  "71": "Feynman has been called the \"Great Explainer\".",
  "72": "He gained a reputation for taking great care when giving explanations to his students and for making it a moral duty to make the topic accessible.",
  "73": "His guiding principle was that, if a topic could not be explained in a freshman lecture, it was not yet fully understood.",
  "74": "Feynman gained great pleasure from coming up with such a \"freshman-level\" explanation, for example, of the connection between spin and statistics.",
  "75": "What he said was that groups of particles with spin  \"repel\", whereas groups with integer spin \"clump\".",
  "76": "This was a brilliantly simplified way of demonstrating how FermiDirac statistics and BoseEinstein statistics evolved as a consequence of studying how fermions and bosons behave under a rotation of 360.",
  "77": "This was also a question he pondered in his more advanced lectures, and to which he demonstrated the solution in the 1986 Dirac memorial lecture.",
  "78": "In the same lecture, he further explained that antiparticles must exist, for if particles had only positive energies, they would not be restricted to a so-called \"light cone\".",
  "79": "He also developed Feynman diagrams, a bookkeeping device that helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between particles in spacetime, including the interactions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons.",
  "80": "This device allowed him, and later others, to approach time reversibility and other fundamental processes.",
  "81": "Feynman's mental picture for these diagrams started with the hard sphere approximation, and the interactions could be thought of as collisions at first.",
  "82": "It was not until decades later that physicists thought of analyzing the nodes of the Feynman diagrams more closely.",
  "83": "Feynman painted Feynman diagrams on the exterior of his van.",
  "84": "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces.",
  "85": "Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model.",
  "86": "The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann.",
  "87": "The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\".",
  "88": "In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.",
  "89": "The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons.",
  "90": "It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses.",
  "91": "For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon.",
  "92": "These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem.",
  "93": "Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.",
  "94": "After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum gravity.",
  "95": "By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field, and derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity, but little more.",
  "96": "The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, \"ghosts\", which are \"particles\" in the interior of his diagrams that have the \"wrong\" connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the YangMills theories, for example, QCD and the electro-weak theory.",
  "97": "Feynman was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1965.",
  "98": "At this time in the early 1960s, Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time, including a request, while at Caltech, to \"spruce up\" the teaching of undergraduates.",
  "99": "After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics.",
  "100": "He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book.",
  "101": "Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword.",
  "102": "The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years.",
  "103": "Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics.",
  "104": "Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.",
  "105": "In 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience due to a lack of \"a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty\" on the part of the scientist.",
  "106": "He instructed the graduating class that \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourselfand you are the easiest person to fool.",
  "107": "So you have to be very careful about that.",
  "108": "After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists.",
  "109": "You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.\"",
  "110": "In the late 1980s, according to \"Richard Feynman and the Connection Machine\", Feynman played a crucial role in developing the first massively parallel computer, and in finding innovative uses for it in numerical computations, in building neural networks, as well as physical simulations using cellular automata (such as turbulent fluid flow), working with Stephen Wolfram at Caltech.",
  "111": "His son Carl also played a role in the development of the original Connection Machine engineering; Feynman influencing the interconnects while his son worked on the software.",
  "112": "Feynman diagrams are now fundamental for string theory and M-theory, and have even been extended topologically.",
  "113": "The world-lines of the diagrams have developed to become tubes to allow better modeling of more complicated objects such as strings and membranes.",
  "114": "Shortly before his death, Feynman criticized string theory in an interview: \"I don't like that they're not calculating anything,\" he said.",
  "115": "\"I don't like that they don't check their ideas.",
  "116": "I don't like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment, they cook up an explanationa fix-up to say, 'Well, it still might be true.'\"",
  "117": "These words have since been much-quoted by opponents of the string-theoretic direction for particle physics.",
  "118": "Feynman devoted the latter half of his book What Do You Care What Other People Think?",
  "119": "to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative.",
  "120": "Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected.",
  "121": "His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts.",
  "122": "For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200.",
  "123": "He concluded that the space shuttle reliability estimate by NASA management was fantastically unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used these figures to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program.",
  "124": "He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\"",
  "125": "Although born to and raised by parents who were Ashkenazi, Feynman was not only an atheist, but declined to be labelled Jewish.",
  "126": "He routinely refused to be included in lists or books that classified people by race.",
  "127": "He asked to not be included in Tina Levitan's The Laureates: Jewish Winners of the Nobel Prize, writing, \"To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory,\" and adding \"... at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'.\"",
  "128": "While pursuing his PhD at Princeton, Feynman married his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum (often misspelled \"Arlene\"), despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill with tuberculosisan incurable disease at the time.",
  "129": "She died in 1945.",
  "130": "In 1946, Feynman wrote a letter to her, expressing his deep love and heartbreak, that he kept for the rest of his life.",
  "131": "(\"Please excuse my not mailing this,\" the letter concluded, \"but I don't know your new address.\")",
  "132": "This portion of Feynman's life was portrayed in the 1996 film Infinity, which featured Feynman's daughter, Michelle, in a cameo role.",
  "133": "Feynman had a great deal of success teaching Carl, using, for example, discussions about ants and Martians as a device for gaining perspective on problems and issues.",
  "134": "He was surprised to learn that the same teaching devices were not useful with Michelle.",
  "135": "Mathematics was a common interest for father and son; they both entered the computer field as consultants and were involved in advancing a new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problemslater known as parallel computing.",
  "136": "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory retained Feynman as a computational consultant during critical missions.",
  "137": "One co-worker characterized Feynman as akin to Don Quixote at his desk, rather than at a computer workstation, ready to do battle with the windmills.",
  "138": "Feynman traveled to Brazil, where he gave courses at the BCPF (Brazilian Center for Physics Research) and near the end of his life schemed to visit the Russian land of Tuva, a dream that, because of Cold War bureaucratic problems, never became reality.",
  "139": "The day after he died, a letter arrived for him from the Soviet government, giving him authorization to travel to Tuva.",
  "140": "Later Feynman's daughter Michelle would realize this journey.",
  "141": "Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase \"Tuva or Bust\" (also the title of a book about his efforts to get there), which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they, one day, could see it firsthand.",
  "142": "The documentary movie, Genghis Blues, mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends.",
  "143": "Responding to Hubert Humphrey's congratulation for his Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president.",
  "144": "According to Genius, the James Gleick-authored biography, Feynman tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech.",
  "145": "Somewhat embarrassed by his actions, he largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes; he mentions it in passing in the \"O Americano, Outra Vez\" section, while the \"Altered States\" chapter in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!",
  "146": "describes only marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, as a way of studying consciousness.",
  "147": "Feynman gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brainthe same reason given in \"O Americano, Outra Vez\" for his reluctance to experiment with LSD.",
  "148": "In Surely You're Joking, Mr.",
  "149": "Feynman!, he gives advice on the best way to pick up a girl in a hostess bar.",
  "150": "At Caltech, he used a nude or topless bar as an office away from his usual office, making sketches or writing physics equations on paper placemats.",
  "151": "When the county officials tried to close the place, all visitors except Feynman refused to testify in favor of the bar, fearing that their families or patrons would learn about their visits.",
  "152": "Only Feynman accepted, and in court, he affirmed that the bar was a public need, stating that craftsmen, technicians, engineers, common workers, \"and a physics professor\" frequented the establishment.",
  "153": "While the bar lost the court case, it was allowed to remain open as a similar case was pending appeal.",
  "154": "In a 1992 New York Times article on Feynman and his legacy, James Gleick recounts the story of how Murray Gell-Mann described what has become known as \"The Feynman Algorithm\" or \"The Feynman Problem-Solving Algorithm\" to a student: \"The student asks Gell-Mann about Feynman's notes.",
  "155": "Gell-Mann says no, Dick's methods are not the same as the methods used here.",
  "156": "The student asks, well, what are Feynman's methods?",
  "157": "Gell-Mann leans coyly against the blackboard and says: Dick's method is this.",
  "158": "You write down the problem.",
  "159": "You think very hard.",
  "160": "(He shuts his eyes and presses his knuckles parodically to his forehead.)",
  "161": "Then you write down the answer.\"",
  "162": "The Feynman Lectures on Physics is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics, compiled from lectures to Caltech undergraduates in 196164.",
  "163": "As news of the lectures' lucidity grew, professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen.",
  "164": "Co-authors Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form.",
  "165": "The work has endured and is useful to this day.",
  "166": "They were edited and supplemented in 2005 with \"Feynman's Tips on Physics: A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physics\" by Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), with support from Kip Thorne and other physicists."
