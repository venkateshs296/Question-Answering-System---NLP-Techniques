  "33": "The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape.",

  "55": "Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957.",

  "74": "The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices.",
  "75": "The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change.",
  "76": "For example, FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.",
