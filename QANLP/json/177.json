{
  "1": "In psychology, memory is the process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved.",
  "2": "Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli.",
  "3": "In the first stage the information must be changed so that it may be put into the encoding process.",
  "4": "Storage is the second memory stage or process.",
  "5": "This entails that information is maintained over short periods of time.",
  "6": "Finally the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored.",
  "7": "Such information must be located and returned to the consciousness.",
  "8": "Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information, and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons.",
  "9": "Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code.",
  "10": "Conrad (1964) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar (e.g.",
  "11": "E, P, D).",
  "12": "Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically.",
  "13": "Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made.",
  "14": "Short-term memory is also known as working memory.",
  "15": "Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal.",
  "16": "Its capacity is also very limited: George A. Miller (1956), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 72 items (the title of his famous paper, \"The magical number 72\").",
  "17": "Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 45 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking.",
  "18": "For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456) and lastly a four-digit chunk (7890).",
  "19": "This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers.",
  "20": "This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.",
  "21": "The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely.",
  "22": "By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span).",
  "23": "Its capacity is immeasurable.",
  "24": "For example, given a random seven-digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our short-term memory.",
  "25": "On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.",
  "26": "The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently.",
  "27": "For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information.",
  "28": "In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the AtkinsonShiffrin model.",
  "29": "Patient KF was brain damaged, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory.",
  "30": "Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted.",
  "31": "Interestingly, visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.",
  "32": "Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the parietal lobe.",
  "33": "Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain.",
  "34": "The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself.",
  "35": "Without the hippocampus, new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory, as learned from patient Henry Molaison after removal of both his hippocampi, and there will be a very short attention span.",
  "36": "Furthermore, it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning.",
  "37": "Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived.",
  "38": "The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory.",
  "39": "It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response.",
  "40": "With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report.",
  "41": "The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\".",
  "42": "Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four.",
  "43": "After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report.",
  "44": "Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds).",
  "45": "Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed.",
  "46": "This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.",
  "47": "While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966) discovered that, after 20 minutes, test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings (e.g.",
  "48": "big, large, great, huge) long-term.",
  "49": "Another part of long-term memory is episodic memory, \"which attempts to capture information such as 'what', 'when' and 'where'\".",
  "50": "With episodic memory, individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings.",
  "51": "Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young childrens memory.",
  "52": "Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants recognition memory and their recall memory.",
  "53": "Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants recall memory.",
  "54": "Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, retrospective memory, or in the future, prospective memory.",
  "55": "Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory.",
  "56": "In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or remembering to remember (Winograd, 1988).",
  "57": "Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering.",
  "58": "Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue).",
  "59": "Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue).",
  "60": "Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.",
  "61": "Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory.",
  "62": "He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory.",
  "63": "Later research showed this to be false.",
  "64": "Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences.",
  "65": "This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala.",
  "66": "This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala.",
  "67": "Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage.",
  "68": "Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones.",
  "69": "The hippocampus is important for explicit memory.",
  "70": "The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation.",
  "71": "The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also.",
  "72": "The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already.",
  "73": "Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage.",
  "74": "This memory loss includes, retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.",
  "75": "One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain.",
  "76": "Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007).",
  "77": "Convergence-divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved.",
  "78": "Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation.",
  "79": "The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007).",
  "80": "The latter component is also called engram or memory traces (Semon 1904).",
  "81": "Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).",
  "82": "In contrast, procedural memory (or implicit memory) is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning.",
  "83": "It can best be summarized as remember how to do something.",
  "84": "Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory.",
  "85": "It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences.",
  "86": "Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.",
  "87": "The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect.",
  "88": "However, the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague.",
  "89": "[citation needed] Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought.",
  "90": "It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.",
  "91": "One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.",
  "92": "However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005).",
  "93": "Research has revealed that individuals performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age.",
  "94": "Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time.",
  "95": "Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example.",
  "96": "It should be noted that although 6-month-olds can recall information over the short-term, they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information.",
  "97": "It is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two-step sequence in the correct temporal order - that is, recalling step 1 and then step 2.",
  "98": "In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence (such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end), 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order (step 1 and then step 2).",
  "99": "Younger infants (6-month-olds) can only recall one step of a two-step sequence.",
  "100": "Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6-months.",
  "101": "Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory, concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory, concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place.",
  "102": "Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as \"Paris is the capital of France\".",
  "103": "Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time.",
  "104": "Episodic memories often reflect the \"firsts\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship.",
  "105": "These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly.",
  "106": "Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory.",
  "107": "Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience.",
  "108": "One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image.",
  "109": "Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.",
  "110": "[citation needed] Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning.",
  "111": "In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex.",
  "112": "glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus.",
  "113": "Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats.",
  "114": "An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans.",
  "115": "In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group.",
  "116": "Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test) for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped.",
  "117": "Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize.",
  "118": "Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance).",
  "119": "The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.",
  "120": "The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.",
  "121": "Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval.",
  "122": "There is retroactive interference, when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference, where prior learning disrupts recall of new information.",
  "123": "Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information.",
  "124": "Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French  this phenomenon is known as positive transfer.",
  "125": "Up until the middle of the 1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode, retain, and retrieve information.",
  "126": "A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay.",
  "127": "Furthermore, research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time; 6-month-olds can recall information after a 24-hour period, 9-month-olds after up to five weeks, and 20-month-olds after as long as twelve months.",
  "128": "In addition, studies have shown that with age, infants can store information faster.",
  "129": "Whereas 14-month-olds can recall a three-step sequence after being exposed to it once, 6-month-olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it.",
  "130": "Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory.",
  "131": "For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning, while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory.",
  "132": "Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information.",
  "133": "However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit.",
  "134": "Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning, as solely dependent on specific brain regions.",
  "135": "Learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses, thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression.",
  "136": "The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have.",
  "137": "However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus.",
  "138": "Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed.",
  "139": "When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties.",
  "140": "Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents.",
  "141": "Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.",
  "142": "Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages.",
  "143": "Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain.",
  "144": "Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on.",
  "145": "The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate.",
  "146": "This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons.",
  "147": "Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.",
  "148": "This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.",
  "149": "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake.",
  "150": "Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation.",
  "151": "During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened.",
  "152": "This enhances the brains abilities to stabilize and retain memories.",
  "153": "There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation.",
  "154": "System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).",
  "155": "This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesnt enhance every memory.",
  "156": "It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep.",
  "157": "When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex.",
  "158": "The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory.",
  "159": "When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories.",
  "160": "Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.",
  "161": "Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory.",
  "162": "Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level.",
  "163": "One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.",
  "164": "Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.",
  "165": "A UCLA research study published in the June 2006 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives.",
  "166": "This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance.",
  "167": "Eight subjects were asked to follow a \"brain healthy\" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques).",
  "168": "After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance.",
  "169": "No long term follow up was conducted, it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.",
  "170": "Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia.",
  "171": "Loss of memory is known as amnesia.",
  "172": "Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus.",
  "173": "There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain.",
  "174": "Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition.",
  "175": "Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored.",
  "176": "Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.",
  "177": "Physical exercise, particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running, cycling and swimming, has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain.",
  "178": "Influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels, improved oxygen and nutrient delivery, and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",
  "179": "The effects of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children's academic performance, maintaining mental abilities in old age, and the prevention and potential cure of neurological diseases.",
  "180": "However, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress.",
  "181": "A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.",
  "182": "Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards  a computerized version of the card game \"Concentration\" or \"Memory\".",
  "183": "The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory.",
  "184": "Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present, or in a different room without the fragrance.",
  "185": "The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context); however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).",
  "186": "All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.",
  "187": "Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories.",
  "188": "For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing.",
  "189": "Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment.",
  "190": "Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events.",
  "191": "The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.",
  "192": "That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.",
  "193": "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case.",
  "194": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime.",
  "195": "In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed.",
  "196": "People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them.",
  "197": "To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw.",
  "198": "The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\"",
  "199": "gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\"",
  "200": "Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit.",
  "201": "There was no broken glass depicted in the film.",
  "202": "Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers memories of the event.",
  "203": "Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event  those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.",
  "204": "The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.",
  "205": "Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim.",
  "206": "Rote learning is the method most often used.",
  "207": "Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets.",
  "208": "The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time.",
  "209": "In contrast to this is cramming: an intensive memorization in a short period of time.",
  "210": "Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones.",
  "211": "The so-called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information."
