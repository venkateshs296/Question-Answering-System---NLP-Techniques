  "16": "Those that escaped envelopment and capture were rapidly forced back north all the way to the border with China at the Yalu River, or into the mountainous interior.",
  "17": "At this point, in October 1950, Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war.",
  "18": "Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued until mid-1951.",
  "19": "After these dramatic reversals of fortune, which saw Seoul change hands four times, the last two years of conflict became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel.",

  "21": "North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign.",
  "22": "Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their Communist allies.",

  "25": "Korea was considered to be part of the Empire of Japan as an industrialized colony along with Taiwan, and both were part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.",
  "26": "In 1937, the colonial Governor-General, General Jir Minami, commanded the attempted cultural assimilation of Korea's 23.5 million people by banning the use and study of Korean language, literature, and culture, to be replaced with that of mandatory use and study of their Japanese counterparts.",

  "36": "This was incorporated into America's General Order No.",
  "37": "1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August.",
  "38": "Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, \"even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement...we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops\".",
  "39": "He noted that he was \"faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area\".",
  "40": "As Rusk's comments indicate, the Americans doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this.",
  "41": "Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.",
  "42": "On 8 September 1945, U.S. Lt. Gen. John R. Hodge arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel.",

  "64": "North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China.",
  "65": "The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.",
  "66": "As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.",
  "67": "China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.",
  "68": "The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-sung's authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il-yu, who was later purged by Kim.",
  "69": "After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security.",
  "70": "Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.",
  "71": "As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.",
  "72": "By spring 1950, Stalin believed the strategic situation had changed.",
  "73": "The Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September 1949; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea; the Americans had not intervened to stop the communist victory in China, and Stalin calculated that the Americans would be even less willing to fight in Koreawhich had seemingly much less strategic significance.",
  "74": "The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with the US embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation.",
  "75": "Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the SinoSoviet Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance Treaty.",
  "76": "In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed.",
  "77": "Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the Americans.",
  "78": "Kim met with Mao in May 1950.",
  "79": "Mao was concerned that the Americans would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion.",
  "80": "China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.",
  "81": "At that time, the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5.6 million soldiers.",
  "82": "However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border.",
  "83": "Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated.",
  "84": "Soviet generals with extensive combat experience from the Second World War were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group.",
  "85": "These generals completed the plans for the attack by May.",
  "86": "The original plans called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea.",
  "87": "The North Koreans would then launch a \"counterattack\" that would capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the South Korean army.",
  "88": "The final stage would involve destroying South Korean government remnants, capturing the rest of South Korea, including the ports.",
  "89": "On 7 June 1950, Kim Il-sung called for a Korea-wide election on 58 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 1517 June 1950.",
  "90": "On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South, as a peace overture that Rhee rejected.",
  "91": "On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin peninsula.",
  "92": "Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses.",
  "93": "Stalin agreed to this change of plan.",
  "94": "While these preparations were underway in the North, there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, many initiated by the South.",
  "95": "The Republic of Korea Army (ROK Army) was being trained by the U.S. Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG).",
  "96": "On the eve of war, KMAG's commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide \"target practice\".",
  "97": "For his part, Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North, including when American diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June.",
  "98": "At dawn on Sunday, 25 June 1950, the Korean People's Army crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire.",
  "99": "The KPA justified its assault with the claim that ROK troops had attacked first, and that they were aiming to arrest and execute the \"bandit traitor Syngman Rhee\".",
  "100": "Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin peninsula in the west.",
  "101": "There were initial South Korean claims that they had captured the city of Haeju, and this sequence of events has led some scholars to argue that the South Koreans actually fired first.",
  "102": "On 27 June, Rhee evacuated from Seoul with some of the government.",
  "103": "On 28 June, at 2 am, the South Korean Army blew up the highway bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the North Korean army.",
  "104": "The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing the bridge, and hundreds were killed.",
  "105": "Destroying the bridge also trapped many South Korean military units north of the Han River.",
  "106": "In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day.",
  "107": "A number of South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell, and forty-eight subsequently pledged allegiance to the North.",
  "108": "One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan.",
  "109": "Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, U.S. East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region.",
  "110": "While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea.",
  "111": "Said Kim: \"The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene...",
  "112": "The essential point... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan.\"",
  "113": "A major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the US intervened.",
  "114": "The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea.",
  "115": "At the same time, \"[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]\".",
  "116": "Yugoslaviaa possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin Splitwas vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council's post-North Korea invasion list of \"chief danger spots\".",
  "117": "Truman believed if aggression went unchecked a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the United Nations and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere.",
  "118": "The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end.",
  "119": "The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.",
  "120": "On 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with UN Security Council Resolution 82.",
  "121": "The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Republic of China (Taiwan), not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.",
  "122": "After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea.",
  "123": "On 27 June President Truman ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean regime.",
  "124": "On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the United States of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.",
  "125": "The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons.",
  "126": "The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the Korean conflict was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial northsouth border fighting was classed as a civil war.",
  "127": "Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members.",
  "128": "By mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin.",
  "129": "Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, some 150 Yak fighter planes, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft.",
  "130": "In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.",
  "131": "Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies.",
  "132": "In contrast, the ROK Army defenders were relatively unprepared and ill-equipped.",

  "134": "Appleman reports the ROK forces' low combat readiness as of 25 June 1950.",
  "135": "The ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT6 advanced-trainer airplanes.",
  "136": "There were no large foreign military garrisons in Korea at the time of the invasion, but there were large U.S. garrisons and air forces in Japan.",
  "137": "On Saturday, 24 June 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea.",
  "138": "Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated.",
  "139": "Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War.",
  "140": "However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975): As an initial response, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only 'on paper', since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request.",
  "141": "In fact, because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength.",
  "142": "General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with re-organizing and deploying an American military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart.",
  "143": "The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as American troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions.",
  "144": "Lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven back down the Korean peninsula to Pusan.",
  "145": "In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that \"Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.\"",
  "146": "Acting on State Secretary Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer matriel to the Army of the Republic of Korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of U.S. nationals.",
  "147": "The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea.",
  "148": "The United States denied ROC's request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation.",
  "149": "Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to \"neutralize\" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as \"armed aggression on Chinese territory.\"",
  "150": "The Battle of Osan, the first significant American engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division which had been flown in from Japan.",
  "151": "On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans' tanks.",
  "152": "They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner.",
  "153": "The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the US force at Pyongtaek, Chonan, and Chochiwon, forcing the 24th Division's retreat to Taejeon, which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon; the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including the Division's Commander, Major General William F. Dean.",
  "154": "By August, the KPA had pushed back the ROK Army and the Eighth United States Army to the vicinity of Pusan in southeast Korea.",
  "155": "In their southward advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals.",
  "156": "On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung that he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities.",
  "157": "By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River.",
  "158": "Although Kim's early successes had led him to predict that he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic.",
  "159": "To counter a possible U.S. deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang.",
  "160": "Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea.",
  "161": "Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon.",
  "162": "After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for American naval activity in the Korea Strait.",
  "163": "In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter (AugustSeptember 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge, P'ohang-dong, and Taegu.",
  "164": "The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic.",
  "165": "KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.",
  "166": "To deny matriel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs.",
  "167": "Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south.",
  "168": "On 27 August, 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident.",
  "169": "The US proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the US should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the US proposal.",
  "170": "Meanwhile, U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and matriel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter.",
  "171": "Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the U.S. mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port.",
  "172": "By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready.",
  "173": "In early September 1950, ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers.",
  "174": "The UN forces, once prepared, counterattacked and broke out of the Pusan Perimeter.",
  "175": "Against the rested and re-armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN Command, they lacked naval and air support.",
  "176": "To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Inchon (now known as Incheon), near Seoul and well over 100 miles (160 km) behind the KPA lines.",
  "177": "On 6 July, he ordered Major General Hobart R. Gay, Commander, 1st Cavalry Division, to plan the division's amphibious landing at Incheon; on 1214 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from Yokohama, Japan to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.",
  "178": "Soon after the war began, General MacArthur had begun planning a landing at Incheon, but the Pentagon opposed him.",
  "179": "When authorized, he activated a combined U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and ROK Army force.",
  "180": "The X Corps, led by General Edward Almond, Commander, consisted of 40,000 men of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around 8,600 ROK Army soldiers.",
  "181": "By 15 September, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle.",
  "182": "However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon.",
  "183": "After the Incheon landing, the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter.",
  "184": "\"Task Force Lynch\" (after Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch), 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and two 70th Tank Battalion units (Charlie Company and the IntelligenceReconnaissance Platoon) effected the \"Pusan Perimeter Breakout\" through 106.4 miles (171.2 km) of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan.",
  "185": "The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea.",
  "186": "On 18 September, Stalin dispatched General H. M. Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul.",
  "187": "Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans.",
  "188": "As the overall commander of Chinese forces, Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north.",
  "189": "On 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces.",
  "190": "American air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery.",
  "191": "North Korean troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable.",
  "192": "During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers managed to rejoin the Northern KPA lines.",
  "193": "On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.",
  "194": "On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if \"at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily...\" On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.",
  "195": "On 30 September, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: \"We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel.\"",
  "196": "During October, the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951.",
  "197": "On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel.",
  "198": "Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.",
  "199": "Historian Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.",
  "200": "By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea.",
  "201": "MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.",
  "202": "Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards.",

  "206": "The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue American prisoners of war.",
  "207": "At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war.",
  "208": "As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50100 miles of mountainous terrain.",
  "209": "On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC).",
  "210": "On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force.",
  "211": "China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\".",
  "212": "In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 25 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea.",
  "213": "There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the U.S. in Korea.",
  "214": "Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him.",
  "215": "After Lin Biao politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment), Mao decided that Peng Dehuai would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position.",
  "216": "Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders.",
  "217": "After Peng made the case that if U.S. troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea.",
  "218": "Later, the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened.",
  "219": "On 8 October 1950, Mao Zedong redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA).",
  "220": "In order to enlist Stalin's support, Zhou and a Chinese delegation left for Moscow on 8 October, arriving there on 10 October at which point they flew to Stalin's home at the Black Sea.",
  "221": "There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov.",
  "222": "Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations.",
  "223": "In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time.",
  "224": "Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.",
  "225": "Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu.",
  "226": "Soviet shipments of matriel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like.",
  "227": "UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection.",
  "228": "The PVA marched \"dark-to-dark\" (19:0003:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30.",
  "229": "Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site.",
  "230": "During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators.",
  "231": "Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 286 miles (460 km) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days.",
  "232": "Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 18 miles (29 km) daily for 18 days.",
  "233": "Meanwhile, on 10 October 1950, the 89th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, increasing the armor available for the Northern Offensive.",
  "234": "On 15 October, after moderate KPA resistance, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and Charlie Company, 70th Tank Battalion captured Namchonjam city.",

  "237": "Kim Il Sung and his government temporarily moved its capital to Sinuiju  although as UNC forces approached, the government again moved  this time to Kanggye.",
  "238": "On 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at Wake Island in the mid-Pacific Ocean.",
  "239": "This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental United States.",
  "240": "To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed.",
  "241": "He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River.",
  "242": "He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, \"if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter\" without air force protection.",
  "243": "After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border.",
  "244": "This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union.",
  "245": "Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China.",
  "246": "After decimating the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaultsfrom the north, northwest, and westand overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan.",
  "247": "The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch'ongch'on River, while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory.",
  "248": "It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory.",
  "249": "On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then decimated the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank.",
  "250": "The UN Command retreated; the U.S. Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history) was made possible because of the Turkish Brigade's successful, but very costly, rear-guard delaying action near Kunuri that slowed the PVA attack for two days (2729 November).",
  "251": "On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,00015,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support firealbeit with some 15,000 collective casualties.",
  "252": "By 30 November, the PVA 13th Army Group managed to expel the U.S. Eighth Army from northwest Korea.",
  "253": "Retreating from the north faster than they had counter-invaded, the Eighth Army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid December.",
  "254": "UN morale hit rock bottom when commanding General Walton Walker of the U.S. Eighth Army was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident.",
  "255": "In northeast Korea by 11 December, the U.S. X Corps managed to cripple the PVA 9th Army Group while establishing a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam.",
  "256": "The X Corps were forced to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted U.S. Eighth Army to the south.",
  "257": "During the Hungnam evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and matriel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan.",
  "258": "The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers.",
  "259": "Before escaping, the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city, especially the port facilities; and on 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No.",

  "261": "99 (1953), which remained in force until 14 September 1978.",
  "262": "[b] The next day (17 December 1950) Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.",
  "263": "After that, the leading part of the war became the Chinese army.",
  "264": "Following that, on 1 February 1951, United Nations General Assembly adopted a draft resolution condemning China as an aggressor in the Korean War.",
  "265": "With Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive (also known as the \"Chinese New Year's Offensive\") on New Year's Eve of 1950.",
  "266": "Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy.",
  "267": "UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south.",
  "268": "The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to conquer Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951.",
  "269": "UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.",
  "270": "The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and matriel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines.",
  "271": "In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Roundup (5 February 1951).",
  "272": "A full-scale X Corps advance proceeded, which fully exploited the UN Command's air superiority, concluding with the UN reaching the Han River and recapturing Wonju.",
  "273": "In early February, the South Korean 11th Division ran the operation to destroy the guerrillas and their sympathizer citizens in Southern Korea.",
  "274": "During the operation, the division and police conducted the Geochang massacre and Sancheong-Hamyang massacre.",
  "275": "In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong.",
  "276": "But the offensive was soon blunted by the IX Corps positions at Chipyong-ni in the center.",
  "277": "Units of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum.",
  "278": "The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War.",
  "279": "The battle saw 5,600 Korean, American and French troops defeat a numerically superior Chinese force.",
  "280": "Surrounded on all sides, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division Warrior Division's 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 Chinese Communist forces.",
  "281": "United Nations forces had previously retreated in the face of large Communist forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought at odds of roughly 15 to 1.",
  "282": "In the last two weeks of February 1951, Operation Roundup was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army.",
  "283": "It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible.",
  "284": "Operation Killer concluded with I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong.",
  "285": "On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951.",
  "286": "This was the city's fourth conquest in a years' time, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5 million pre-war population was down to 200,000, and people were suffering from severe food shortages.",
  "287": "On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover, especially over supply lines.",
  "288": "Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks.",
  "289": "PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war.",
  "290": "In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing.",
  "291": "What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded.",
  "292": "Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient.",
  "293": "At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward.",
  "294": "On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea.",
  "295": "There were several reasons for the dismissal.",
  "296": "MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses.",
  "297": "He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision, not the President's.",
  "298": "MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered.",
  "299": "While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution.",
  "300": "MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution.",
  "301": "A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.",
  "302": "General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander, Korea; he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks, while General James Van Fleet assumed command of the U.S. Eighth Army.",
  "303": "Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (2328 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March 1951) were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul.",
  "304": "UN forces advanced to \"Line Kansas\", north of the 38th parallel.",
  "305": "The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team's (\"Rakkasans\") second of two combat jumps was on Easter Sunday, 1951, at Munsan-ni, South Korea, codenamed Operation Tomahawk.",
  "306": "The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their movement north.",
  "307": "The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission.",
  "308": "The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, also known as the Chinese Spring Offensive, with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).",
  "309": "The offensive's first thrust fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (2225 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (2225 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the \"No-name Line\" north of Seoul.",
  "310": "On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River.",
  "311": "After initial success, they were halted by 20 May.",
  "312": "At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained \"Line Kansas\", just north of the 38th parallel.",
  "313": "The UN's \"Line Kansas\" halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.",
  "314": "For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held.",
  "315": "Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong.",
  "316": "On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team.",
  "317": "Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.",
  "318": "The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.",
  "319": "The principal battles of the stalemate include the Battle of Bloody Ridge (18 August15 September 1951), the Battle of the Punchbowl (31 August-21 September 1951), the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge (13 September15 October 1951), the Battle of Old Baldy (26 June4 August 1952), the Battle of White Horse (615 October 1952), the Battle of Triangle Hill (14 October25 November 1952), the Battle of Hill Eerie (21 March21 June 1952), the sieges of Outpost Harry (1018 June 1953), the Battle of the Hook (2829 May 1953), the Battle of Pork Chop Hill (23 March16 July 1953), and the Battle of Kumsong (1327 July 1953).",
  "320": "Chinese troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers.",
  "321": "All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops.",
  "322": "The situation became so serious that, on November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems.",
  "323": "At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible.",
  "324": "These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.",
  "325": "In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities.",
  "326": "Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future.",
  "327": "On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort.",
  "328": "After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: \"You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have!",
  "329": "Not to speak of the casualties!",
  "330": "For what are they giving their lives?",
  "331": "We have no aircraft.",
  "332": "We have only a few guns.",
  "333": "Transports are not protected.",
  "334": "More and more soldiers are dying of starvation.",
  "335": "Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?\"",
  "336": "The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference.",
  "337": "Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.",
  "338": "The on-again, off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years, first at Kaesong, on the border between North and South Korea, and then at the neighbouring village of Panmunjom.",
  "339": "A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation.",
  "340": "The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.",
  "341": "In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, under the chairman Indian General K. S. Thimayya, was set up to handle the matter.",
  "342": "In 1952, the United States elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War.",
  "343": "With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel.",
  "344": "Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands.",
  "345": "The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west.",
  "346": "The old Korean capital city of Kaesong, site of the armistice negotiations, originally was in pre-war South Korea, but now is part of North Korea.",
  "347": "The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting.",
  "348": "The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks.",
  "349": "The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty.",
  "350": "North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War.",
  "351": "After the war, Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead.",
  "352": "The remains of 4,167 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government.",
  "353": "After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (The Punchbowl), on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.",
  "354": "Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct.",
  "355": "From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals.",
  "356": "Of these, 2,944 were identified as American, and all but 416 were identified by name.",
  "357": "From 1996 to 2006, the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.",
  "358": "After a new wave of UN sanctions, on 11 March 2013, North Korea claimed that it had invalidated the 1953 armistice.",
  "359": "On 13 March 2013, North Korea confirmed it ended the 1953 Armistice and declared North Korea \"is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression\".",
  "360": "On 30 March 2013, North Korea stated that it had entered a \"state of war\" with South Korea and declared that \"The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over\".",
  "361": "Speaking on 4 April 2013, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, informed the press that Pyongyang had \"formally informed\" the Pentagon that it had \"ratified\" the potential usage of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the United States of America, including Guam and Hawaii.",
  "362": "Hagel also stated that the United States would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system to Guam, because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat from North Korea.",
  "363": "The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces were aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks.",
  "364": "A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion.",
  "365": "These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s.",
  "366": "Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed.",
  "367": "The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and those United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered.",
  "368": "Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor.",
  "369": "The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including M4A3 Sherman medium tanks backed by U.S. M26 heavy tanks, along with the British Centurion, Churchill, and Cromwell tanks.",
  "370": "Because neither Korea had a significant navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles.",
  "371": "A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Juneau, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Jamaica, and the frigate HMS Black Swan fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them.",
  "372": "USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present.",
  "373": "The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon.",
  "374": "Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea.",
  "375": "Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea.",
  "376": "The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces.",
  "377": "During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea.",
  "378": "Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines.",
  "379": "During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug.",
  "380": "Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage.",
  "381": "The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) of North Korea with the MiG-15, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters.",
  "382": "The fast, heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the F-80 (United States Air Force) and Gloster Meteors (Royal Australian Air Force), posing a real threat to B-29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort.",
  "383": "Fearful of confronting the United States directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian.",
  "384": "This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union, and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.",
  "385": "The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the F-86 Sabre.",
  "386": "These arrived in December 1950.",
  "387": "The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor.",
  "388": "It had a very high service ceiling50,000 feet (15,000 m) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons.",
  "389": "They were fast enough to dive past the fighter escort of P-80 Shooting Stars and F9F Panthers and could reach and destroy the U.S. heavy bombers.",
  "390": "B-29 losses could not be avoided, and the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the necessarily less accurate nighttime bombing of targets.",
  "391": "The MiGs were countered by the F-86 Sabres.",
  "392": "They had a ceiling of 42,000 feet (13,000 m) and were armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar gunsights.",
  "393": "If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG.",
  "394": "Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 660 mph (1,100 km/h).",
  "395": "The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better."
